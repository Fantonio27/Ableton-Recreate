                        Berlin

                    <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day.
                        We
                        come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are
                        self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that
                        each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the
                        future
                        of music culture.</p>

                        don’t always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>
